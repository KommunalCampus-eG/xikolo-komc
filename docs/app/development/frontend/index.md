# Frontend

The Xikolo frontend is rendered on the server side.
This means that Ruby (and) Rails knowledge is very useful.

Of course, the usual web technologies like [HTML](html_styleguide.md), [CSS](CSS/css_styleguide.md) and [JavaScript](js_styleguide.md) also play a large role.

## Architecture

We use [components](components/index.md) to structure the frontend into composable units.
