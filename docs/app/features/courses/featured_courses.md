# Featured courses

Featured courses allow highlighting specific courses on the course list.
They can be configured via classifiers for a course or via the platform administration.

!!! note

    Only one course can be featured at a time, so this setting should be updated regularly.

## Advantages of featuring courses

- Announce specific courses.
- Increase visibility of specific courses in general.
- Draw attention to courses that do not yet have many enrollments.

## How to feature a course

1. Go to the course you want to feature.
2. Click on "Course Administration" → "Settings".
3. Within the settings for "Categorization", the tags for the "Course List" cluster can be selected.
4. Click into the field and select "Featured".

    If the course still does not appear as a featured course, you might need to un-feature the previously featured one.
