# Tab Navigation

The `Navigation::Tabs` component provides a way to organize and navigate between different sections or views within a user interface.
It allows users to switch between content areas by clicking on corresponding tabs.

## Overview

It supports both links and buttons as tab items,
offering a flexible way to build a responsive navigation UI.
If you insert other elements, this might need further custom CSS.

## Indicate active tab

Indicating the active tab is essential for users to recognize their current selection within the interface.

## Collapsible

For interfaces with numerous tabs,
a collapsible layout offers a more responsive navigation experience.
When configuring the TabNavigation component with `collapsible: true`,
the tabs adjust automatically based on the screen size,
making the component more versatile.

This configuration is optional,
because interfaces with only two or three tabs collapsing may not be necessary.

### Layout

On larger screens, the tabs are aligned horizontally,
while on smaller screens, the component switches to a vertical layout.
A button for expanding or collapsing the tab content is also provided.

**Hint:** To preview this behavior, use LookBook's resize handle to test responsiveness.

## Panels

When configured with panels,
the component shows or hides content upon clicking a tab.
This setup allows users to view content related to each tab without navigating away from the current page.

**Important!**

- Each tab must include a `controls` attribute that references the `id` of its corresponding panel.
- Ensure that the `active` state of both the tab and the panel matches.
