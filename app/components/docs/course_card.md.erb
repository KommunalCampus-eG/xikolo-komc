# Course card

A course card displays relevant and actionable information on a specific course.
We have two types of course cards that should be used depending on the context.

## Expandable

<lookbook-embed app="http://localhost:3000/rails/components/" preview="Home::CourseCardPreview" scenario="expandable"></lookbook-embed>

This is the default type of the card.
Until hovered, it only shows high-level information about the course and no action buttons.
It transitions from the collapsed state to an expanded state on hover, where more information and action buttons are shown.

## Compact

<lookbook-embed app="http://localhost:3000/rails/components/" preview="Home::CourseCardPreview" scenario="compact"></lookbook-embed>

With a `type = 'compact'` configuration, the course card is displayed as an intermediate state between collapsed and expanded.
It does not feature an expansion on hover.

To be used in pages where users don't require details about the course because they already know it well, but action buttons are needed (e.g, on the dashboard page).
