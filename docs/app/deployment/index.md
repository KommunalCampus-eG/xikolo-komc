# Deployment

This section provides guidance on deploying and operating our platform software, either [the open source version](opensource/index.md) or managing the internal setup.

Our deployment process is designed to streamline the configuration and management of the application and its peripheral services. You'll find detailed information on:

- :material-package-variant: **Software packages**: Insights into how the application and its services are packaged for deployment (Debian packages).
- :material-cog-outline: **Configuration**: Guidelines on setting up application and service-specific configurations, such as databases, caching, and messaging.
- :material-rocket-launch-outline: **CI pipelines**: An overview of the continuous integration pipelines that support deployment automation and ensure robust delivery practices.

Whether you're setting up for the first time or fine-tuning an existing deployment, this guide is your go-to resource for achieving a smooth and efficient operational environment.
