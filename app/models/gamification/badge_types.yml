# GAMIFICATION: BADGES AND LEVELS
#
# This file lists all badges and what it takes to achieve them (at various levels).
# The top-level hash keys are the badge types. Each badge must list what +rules+
# (events) are counted towards the badge. The +levels+ hash determines how many
# scores (the value) users need to accumulate to achieve a given level (the key)
# of the badge.
#
# Images for each badge must be placed in app/assets/images/gamification/badges.
